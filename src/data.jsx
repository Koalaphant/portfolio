          SplendEvent is an events management platform designed for a wide
          variety of events such as theatre performances, concerts, and stand-up
          comedy shows. Over the past month, I‚Äôve been working on this freelance

          The platform allows users to create an account, browse, register, and
          sign up for both free and paid events, add bookings to Google

          organisers benefit from an admin dashboard that allows them to manage
          events and track sales and customer data.
